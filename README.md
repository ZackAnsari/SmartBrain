<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>SmartBrain is an innovative face recognition web application developed using React. This project showcases the integration of advanced AI technologies with modern web development practices to create a highly interactive user experience. SmartBrain allows users to upload or provide image URLs, and utilizes AI algorithms to detect and highlight human faces in these images. This application exemplifies the use of artificial intelligence in enhancing user interaction and providing practical functionality in web applications.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advanced Face Detection</strong>: Utilizes the Clarifai Face Detection API to accurately identify and highlight faces in any uploaded image, demonstrating the power of AI in image processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive User Interface</strong>: Built with React, the application features a dynamic and responsive user interface that updates in real time, providing immediate visual feedback to user interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Secure User Authentication</strong>: Incorporates a robust user authentication system, allowing users to securely create accounts, log in, and manage their sessions with confidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Image Submission and Processing</strong>: Users can submit images via URL, which are then processed by the AI API for face detection. The app elegantly handles and displays results.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones.</li>
</ul>
